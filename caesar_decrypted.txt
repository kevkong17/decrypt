r,20.5470530899,IN ANOTHER MOMENT DOWN WENT ALICE AFTER IT  NEVER ONCE CONSIDERING HOW IN THE WORLD SHE WAS TO GET OUT AGAIN 
wm,18.9072320866, THE RABBIT HOLE WENT STRAIGHT ON LIKE A TUNNEL FOR SOME WAY  AND THEN DIPPED SUDDENLY DOWN  SO SUDDENLY THAT ALICE HAD NOT A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT STOPPING HERSELF BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF FALLING DOWN A VERY DEEP WELL 
wp,39.2002736944, EITHER THE WELL WAS VERY DEEP  OR SHE FELL VERY SLOWLY  FOR SHE HAD PLENTY OF TIME AS SHE WENT DOWN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND TO WONDER WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT  FIRST  SHE TRIED TO LOOK DOWN AND MAKE OUT WHAT SHE WAS COMING TO  BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING  THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE SIDES OF THE WELL  AND NOTICED THAT THEY WERE FILLED WITH CUPBOARDS AND BOOK SHELVES  HERE AND THERE SHE SAW MAPS AND PICTURES HUNG UPON PEGS  SHE TOOK DOWN A JAR FROM ONE OF THE SHELVES AS SHE PASSED  IT WAS LABELLED  ORANGE MARMALADE   BUT TO HER GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT IT WAS EMPTY  SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DROP THE JAR FOR FEAR OF KILLING SOMEBODY  SO MANAGED TO PUT IT INTO ONE OF THE CUPBOARDS AS SHE FELL PAST IT

wp,30.2407339233, ALICE WAS NOT A BIT HURT  AND SHE JUMPED UP ON TO HER FEET IN A MOMENT SHE LOOKED UP  BUT IT WAS ALL DARK OVERHEAD  BEFORE HER WAS ANOTHER LONG PASSAGE  AND THE WHITE RABBIT WAS STILL IN SIGHT  HURRYING DOWN IT THERE WAS NOT A MOMENT TO BE LOST  AWAY WENT ALICE LIKE THE WIND  AND WAS JUST IN TIME TO HEAR IT SAY  AS IT TURNED A CORNER   OH MY EARS AND WHISKERS  HOW LATE IT S GETTING   SHE WAS CLOSE BEHIND IT WHEN SHE TURNED THE CORNER  BUT THE RABBIT WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN  SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A LONG  LOW HALL  WHICH WAS LIT UP BY A ROW OF LAMPS HANGING FROM THE ROOF 
wz,41.2964881199, THERE WERE DOORS ALL ROUND THE HALL  BUT THEY WERE ALL LOCKED  AND WHEN ALICE HAD BEEN ALL THE WAY DOWN ONE SIDE AND UP THE OTHER  TRYING EVERY DOOR  SHE WALKED SADLY DOWN THE MIDDLE  WONDERING HOW SHE WAS EVER TO GET OUT AGAIN 
wy,30.6807907445, SUDDENLY SHE CAME UPON A LITTLE THREE LEGGED TABLE  ALL MADE OF SOLID GLASS  THERE WAS NOTHING ON IT EXCEPT A TINY GOLDEN KEY  AND ALICE S FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT IT MIGHT BELONG TO ONE OF THE DOORS OF THE HALL BUT  ALAS  EITHER THE LOCKS WERE TOO LARGE  OR THE KEY WAS TOO SMALL BUT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD NOT OPEN ANY OF THEM  HOWEVER  ON THE SECOND TIME ROUND  SHE CAME UPON A LOW CURTAIN SHE HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE  AND BEHIND IT WAS A LITTLE DOOR ABOUT FIFTEEN INCHES HIGH  SHE TRIED THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY IN THE LOCK  AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT IT FITTED 
wd,45.3607838257, ALICE OPENED THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT IT LED INTO A SMALL PASSAGE  NOT MUCH LARGER THAN A RAT HOLE  SHE KNELT DOWN AND LOOKED ALONG THE PASSAGE INTO THE LOVELIEST GARDEN YOU EVER SAW  HOW SHE LONGED TO GET OUT OF THAT DARK HALL  AND WANDER ABOUT AMONG THOSE BEDS OF BRIGHT FLOWERS AND THOSE COOL FOUNTAINS  BUT SHE COULD NOT EVEN GET HER HEAD THROUGH THE DOORWAY   AND EVEN IF MY HEAD WOULD GO THROUGH   THOUGHT POOR ALICE   IT WOULD BE OF VERY LITTLE USE WITHOUT MY SHOULDERS  OH  HOW I WISH I COULD SHUT UP LIKE A TELESCOPE  I THINK I COULD  IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO BEGIN FOR  YOU SEE  SO MANY OUT OF THE WAY THINGS HAD HAPPENED LATELY THAT ALICE HAD BEGUN TO THINK THAT VERY FEW THINGS INDEED WERE REALLY IMPOSSIBLE 
we,29.9757849045, THERE SEEMED TO BE NO USE IN WAITING BY THE LITTLE DOOR  SO SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE  HALF HOPING SHE MIGHT FIND ANOTHER KEY ON IT  OR AT ANY RATE A BOOK OF RULES FOR SHUTTING PEOPLE UP LIKE TELESCOPES  THIS TIME SHE FOUND A LITTLE BOTTLE ON IT  [ WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT HERE BEFORE   SAID ALICE   AND ROUND THE NECK OF THE BOTTLE WAS A PAPER LABEL  WITH THE WORDS  DRINK ME  BEAUTIFULLY PRINTED ON IT IN LARGE LETTERS 
wz,24.9659698483, IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO SAY  DRINK ME   BUT THE WISE LITTLE ALICE WAS NOT GOING TO DO THAT IN A HURRY   NO  I LL LOOK FIRST   SHE SAID   AND SEE WHETHER IT S MARKED  POISON  OR NOT   FOR SHE HAD READ SEVERAL NICE LITTLE HISTORIES ABOUT CHILDREN WHO HAD GOT BURNT  AND EATEN UP BY WILD BEASTS AND OTHER UNPLEASANT THINGS  ALL BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT REMEMBER THE SIMPLE RULES THEIR FRIENDS HAD TAUGHT THEM  SUCH AS  THAT A RED HOT POKER WILL BURN YOU IF YOU HOLD IT TOO LONG  AND THAT IF YOU CUT YOUR FINGER VERY DEEPLY WITH A KNIFE  IT USUALLY BLEEDS  AND SHE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT  IF YOU DRINK MUCH FROM A BOTTLE MARKED  POISON   IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DISAGREE WITH YOU  SOONER OR LATER 
wf,29.2772326924, HOWEVER  THIS BOTTLE WAS NOT MARKED  POISON   SO ALICE VENTURED TO TASTE IT  AND FINDING IT VERY NICE   IT HAD  IN FACT  A SORT OF MIXED FLAVOUR OF CHERRY TART  CUSTARD  PINE APPLE  ROAST TURKEY  TOFFEE  AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST   SHE VERY SOON FINISHED IT OFF

wb,32.8850161585, AFTER A WHILE  FINDING THAT NOTHING MORE HAPPENED  SHE DECIDED ON GOING INTO THE GARDEN AT ONCE  BUT  ALAS FOR POOR ALICE  WHEN SHE GOT TO THE DOOR  SHE FOUND SHE HAD FORGOTTEN THE LITTLE GOLDEN KEY  AND WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO THE TABLE FOR IT  SHE FOUND SHE COULD NOT POSSIBLY REACH IT  SHE COULD SEE IT QUITE PLAINLY THROUGH THE GLASS  AND SHE TRIED HER BEST TO CLIMB UP ONE OF THE LEGS OF THE TABLE  BUT IT WAS TOO SLIPPERY AND WHEN SHE HAD TIRED HERSELF OUT WITH TRYING  THE POOR LITTLE THING SAT DOWN AND CRIED 
wf,32.5421727924, COME  THERE S NO USE IN CRYING LIKE THAT   SAID ALICE TO HERSELF RATHER SHARPLY   I ADVISE YOU TO LEAVE OFF THIS MINUTE   SHE GENERALLY GAVE HERSELF VERY GOOD ADVICE   THOUGH SHE VERY SELDOM FOLLOWED IT AND SOMETIMES SHE SCOLDED HERSELF SO SEVERELY AS TO BRING TEARS INTO HER EYES  AND ONCE SHE REMEMBERED TRYING TO BOX HER OWN EARS FOR HAVING CHEATED HERSELF IN A GAME OF CROQUET SHE WAS PLAYING AGAINST HERSELF FOR THIS CURIOUS CHILD WAS VERY FOND OF PRETENDING TO BE TWO PEOPLE BUT IT S NO USE NOW   THOUGHT POOR ALICE   TO PRETEND TO BE TWO PEOPLE WHY  THERE S HARDLY ENOUGH OF ME LEFT TO MAKE ONE RESPECTABLE PERSON 
wc,22.9356910337, SOON HER EYE FELL ON A LITTLE GLASS BOX THAT WAS LYING UNDER THE TABLE SHE OPENED IT  AND FOUND IN IT A VERY SMALL CAKE  ON WHICH THE WORDS EAT ME  WERE BEAUTIFULLY MARKED IN CURRANTS   WELL  I LL EAT IT   SAID ALICE   AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW LARGER  I CAN REACH THE KEY  AND IF IT MAKES ME GROW SMALLER  I CAN CREEP UNDER THE DOOR  SO EITHER WAY I LL GET INTO THE GARDEN  AND I DON T CARE WHICH HAPPENS

wp,56.7061838108, WHY  SHE  OF COURSE   SAID THE DODO  POINTING TO ALICE WITH ONE FINGER AND THE WHOLE PARTY AT ONCE CROWDED ROUND HER  CALLING OUT IN A CONFUSED WAY   PRIZES  PRIZES 
wh,38.9366917369, ALICE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO  AND IN DESPAIR SHE PUT HER HAND IN HER POCKET  AND PULLED OUT A BOX OF COMFITS   LUCKILY THE SALT WATER HAD NOT GOT INTO IT   AND HANDED THEM ROUND AS PRIZES  THERE WAS EXACTLY ONE A PIECE ALL ROUND

wd,32.1595116576, ALICE THOUGHT THE WHOLE THING VERY ABSURD  BUT THEY ALL LOOKED SO GRAVE THAT SHE DID NOT DARE TO LAUGH  AND  AS SHE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY  SHE SIMPLY BOWED  AND TOOK THE THIMBLE  LOOKING AS SOLEMN AS SHE COULD 
wi,22.5555707234, THE NEXT THING WAS TO EAT THE COMFITS  THIS CAUSED SOME NOISE AND CONFUSION  AS THE LARGE BIRDS COMPLAINED THAT THEY COULD NOT TASTE THEIRS  AND THE SMALL ONES CHOKED AND HAD TO BE PATTED ON THE BACK HOWEVER  IT WAS OVER AT LAST  AND THEY SAT DOWN AGAIN IN A RING  AND BEGGED THE MOUSE TO TELL THEM SOMETHING MORE

wu,29.008797903, CHAPTER IV  THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL 
wm,17.7502354119, IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT  TROTTING SLOWLY BACK AGAIN  AND LOOKING ANXIOUSLY ABOUT AS IT WENT  AS IF IT HAD LOST SOMETHING  AND SHE HEARD IT MUTTERING TO ITSELF  THE DUCHESS  THE DUCHESS  OH MY DEAR PAWS  OH MY FUR AND WHISKERS  SHE LL GET ME EXECUTED  AS SURE AS FERRETS ARE FERRETS  WHERE CAN I HAVE DROPPED THEM  I WONDER   ALICE GUESSED IN A MOMENT THAT IT WAS LOOKING FOR THE FAN AND THE PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES AND SHE VERY GOOD NATUREDLY BEGAN HUNTING ABOUT FOR THEM  BUT THEY WERE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN  EVERYTHING SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED SINCE HER SWIM IN THE POOL  AND THE GREAT HALL  WITH THE GLASS TABLE AND THE LITTLE DOOR HAD VANISHED COMPLETELY 
wq,21.4596885302, VERY SOON THE RABBIT NOTICED ALICE  AS SHE WENT HUNTING ABOUT  AND CALLED OUT TO HER IN AN ANGRY TONE   WHY  MARY ANN  WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE  RUN HOME THIS MOMENT  AND FETCH ME A PAIR OF GLOVES AND A FAN QUICK  NOW   AND ALICE WAS SO MUCH FRIGHTENED THAT SHE RAN OFF AT ONCE IN THE DIRECTION IT POINTED TO  WITHOUT TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE MISTAKE IT HAD MADE 
ws,29.4889835913, HE TOOK ME FOR HIS HOUSEMAID   SHE SAID TO HERSELF AS SHE RAN   HOW SURPRISED HE LL BE WHEN HE FINDS OUT WHO I AM  BUT I D BETTER TAKE HIM HIS FAN AND GLOVES  THAT IS  IF I CAN FIND THEM   AS SHE SAID THIS  SHE CAME UPON A NEAT LITTLE HOUSE  ON THE DOOR OF WHICH WAS A BRIGHT BRASS PLATE WITH THE NAME  W  RABBIT  ENGRAVED UPON IT  SHE WENT IN WITHOUT KNOCKING  AND HURRIED UPSTAIRS  IN GREAT FEAR LEST SHE SHOULD MEET THE REAL MARY ANN  AND BE TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE BEFORE SHE HAD FOUND THE FAN AND GLOVES 
wu,22.4894369909, HOW QUEER IT SEEMS   ALICE SAID TO HERSELF   TO BE GOING MESSAGES FOR A RABBIT  I SUPPOSE DINAH LL BE SENDING ME ON MESSAGES NEXT   AND SHE BEGAN FANCYING THE SORT OF THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN    MISS ALICE  COME HERE DIRECTLY  AND GET READY FOR YOUR WALK    COMING IN A MINUTE NURSE  BUT I VE GOT TO SEE THAT THE MOUSE DOESN T GET OUT   ONLY I DON T THINK   ALICE WENT ON   THAT THEY D LET DINAH STOP IN THE HOUSE IF IT BEGAN ORDERING PEOPLE ABOUT LIKE THAT 
wp,31.9678332619, BY THIS TIME SHE HAD FOUND HER WAY INTO A TIDY LITTLE ROOM WITH A TABLE IN THE WINDOW  AND ON IT  AS SHE HAD HOPED  A FAN AND TWO OR THREE PAIRS OF TINY WHITE KID GLOVES  SHE TOOK UP THE FAN AND A PAIR OF THE GLOVES AND WAS JUST GOING TO LEAVE THE ROOM  WHEN HER EYE FELL UPON A LITTLE BOTTLE THAT STOOD NEAR THE LOOKING GLASS  THERE WAS NO LABEL THIS TIME WITH THE WORDS  DRINK ME   BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE UNCORKED IT AND PUT IT TO HER LIPS   I KNOW SOMETHING INTERESTING IS SURE TO HAPPEN   SHE SAID TO HERSELF   WHENEVER I EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING  SO I LL JUST SEE WHAT THIS BOTTLE DOES  I DO HOPE IT LL MAKE ME GROW LARGE AGAIN  FOR REALLY I M QUITE TIRED OF BEING SUCH A TINY LITTLE THING 
wp,33.7383258687, IT DID SO INDEED  AND MUCH SOONER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED  BEFORE SHE HAD DRUNK HALF THE BOTTLE  SHE FOUND HER HEAD PRESSING AGAINST THE CEILING AND HAD TO STOOP TO SAVE HER NECK FROM BEING BROKEN  SHE HASTILY PUT DOWN THE BOTTLE  SAYING TO HERSELF  THAT S QUITE ENOUGH  I HOPE I SHAN T GROW ANY MORE  AS IT IS  I CAN T GET OUT AT THE DOOR  I DO WISH I HADN T DRUNK QUITE SO MUCH 
we,40.1593306759, ALAS  IT WAS TOO LATE TO WISH THAT  SHE WENT ON GROWING  AND GROWING AND VERY SOON HAD TO KNEEL DOWN ON THE FLOOR  IN ANOTHER MINUTE THERE WAS NOT EVEN ROOM FOR THIS  AND SHE TRIED THE EFFECT OF LYING DOWN WITH ONE ELBOW AGAINST THE DOOR  AND THE OTHER ARM CURLED ROUND HER HEAD STILL SHE WENT ON GROWING  AND  AS A LAST RESOURCE  SHE PUT ONE ARM OUT OF THE WINDOW  AND ONE FOOT UP THE CHIMNEY  AND SAID TO HERSELF  NOW I CAN DO NO MORE  WHATEVER HAPPENS  WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME 
wj,17.3052955443, LUCKILY FOR ALICE  THE LITTLE MAGIC BOTTLE HAD NOW HAD ITS FULL EFFECT AND SHE GREW NO LARGER  STILL IT WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE  AND  AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO SORT OF CHANCE OF HER EVER GETTING OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN  NO WONDER SHE FELT UNHAPPY 
ww,30.4764021153, IT WAS MUCH PLEASANTER AT HOME   THOUGHT POOR ALICE   WHEN ONE WASN T ALWAYS GROWING LARGER AND SMALLER  AND BEING ORDERED ABOUT BY MICE AND RABBITS  I ALMOST WISH I HADN T GONE DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE  AND YET  AND YET  IT S RATHER CURIOUS  YOU KNOW  THIS SORT OF LIFE  I DO WONDER WHAT CAN HAVE HAPPENED TO ME  WHEN I USED TO READ FAIRY TALES  I FANCIED THAT KIND OF THING NEVER HAPPENED  AND NOW HERE I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE THERE OUGHT TO BE A BOOK WRITTEN ABOUT ME  THAT THERE OUGHT  AND WHEN I GROW UP  I LL WRITE ONE  BUT I M GROWN UP NOW   SHE ADDED IN A SORROWFUL TONE   AT LEAST THERE S NO ROOM TO GROW UP ANY MORE HERE 
wg,28.1814594256, BUT THEN   THOUGHT ALICE   SHALL I NEVER GET ANY OLDER THAN I AM NOW  THAT LL BE A COMFORT  ONE WAY  NEVER TO BE AN OLD WOMAN  BUT THEN  ALWAYS TO HAVE LESSONS TO LEARN  OH  I SHOULDN T LIKE THAT 
wc,42.2010449711, OH  YOU FOOLISH ALICE   SHE ANSWERED HERSELF   HOW CAN YOU LEARN LESSONS IN HERE  WHY  THERE S HARDLY ROOM FOR YOU  AND NO ROOM AT ALL FOR ANY LESSON BOOKS 
wb,21.2875171441, AND SO SHE WENT ON  TAKING FIRST ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER  AND MAKING QUITE A CONVERSATION OF IT ALTOGETHER  BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SHE HEARD A VOICE OUTSIDE  AND STOPPED TO LISTEN 
wt,22.4001228309, MARY ANN  MARY ANN   SAID THE VOICE   FETCH ME MY GLOVES THIS MOMENT THEN CAME A LITTLE PATTERING OF FEET ON THE STAIRS  ALICE KNEW IT WAS THE RABBIT COMING TO LOOK FOR HER  AND SHE TREMBLED TILL SHE SHOOK THE HOUSE  QUITE FORGETTING THAT SHE WAS NOW ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES AS LARGE AS THE RABBIT  AND HAD NO REASON TO BE AFRAID OF IT 
we,20.9588175104, PRESENTLY THE RABBIT CAME UP TO THE DOOR  AND TRIED TO OPEN IT  BUT  AS THE DOOR OPENED INWARDS  AND ALICE S ELBOW WAS PRESSED HARD AGAINST IT THAT ATTEMPT PROVED A FAILURE  ALICE HEARD IT SAY TO ITSELF  THEN I LL GO ROUND AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW 
wa,28.9987471244, THAT YOU WON T  THOUGHT ALICE  AND  AFTER WAITING TILL SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD THE RABBIT JUST UNDER THE WINDOW  SHE SUDDENLY SPREAD OUT HER HAND  AND MADE A SNATCH IN THE AIR  SHE DID NOT GET HOLD OF ANYTHING BUT SHE HEARD A LITTLE SHRIEK AND A FALL  AND A CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FROM WHICH SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE IT HAD FALLEN INTO A CUCUMBER FRAME  OR SOMETHING OF THE SORT 
wu,26.4510204139, NEXT CAME AN ANGRY VOICE  THE RABBIT S   PAT  PAT  WHERE ARE YOU   AND THEN A VOICE SHE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE   SURE THEN I M HERE  DIGGING FOR APPLES  YER HONOUR 
wb,18.7947016753, DIGGING FOR APPLES  INDEED   SAID THE RABBIT ANGRILY   HERE  COME AND HELP ME OUT OF THIS    SOUNDS OF MORE BROKEN GLASS 
wg,26.7619281417, NOW TELL ME  PAT  WHAT S THAT IN THE WINDOW 
wd,26.0895995135, SURE  IT S AN ARM  YER HONOUR    HE PRONOUNCED IT  ARRUM 
wl,47.2608113136, AN ARM  YOU GOOSE  WHO EVER SAW ONE THAT SIZE  WHY  IT FILLS THE WHOLE WINDOW 
wh,13.7858689039, SURE  IT DOES  YER HONOUR  BUT IT S AN ARM FOR ALL THAT 
wi,15.7562953775, WELL  IT S GOT NO BUSINESS THERE  AT ANY RATE  GO AND TAKE IT AWAY 
we,21.4819236388, THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE AFTER THIS  AND ALICE COULD ONLY HEAR WHISPERS NOW AND THEN  SUCH AS   SURE  I DON T LIKE IT  YER HONOUR  AT ALL  AT ALL    DO AS I TELL YOU  YOU COWARD   AND AT LAST SHE SPREAD OUT HER HAND AGAIN  AND MADE ANOTHER SNATCH IN THE AIR  THIS TIME THERE WERE TWO LITTLE SHRIEKS  AND MORE SOUNDS OF BROKEN GLASS   WHAT A NUMBER OF CUCUMBER FRAMES THERE MUST BE   THOUGHT ALICE   I WONDER WHAT THEY LL DO NEXT  AS FOR PULLING ME OUT OF THE WINDOW  I ONLY WISH THEY COULD  I M SURE I DON T WANT TO STAY IN HERE ANY LONGER 
wk,49.5047331808, SHE WAITED FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT HEARING ANYTHING MORE  AT LAST CAME A RUMBLING OF LITTLE CARTWHEELS  AND THE SOUND OF A GOOD MANY VOICES ALL TALKING TOGETHER  SHE MADE OUT THE WORDS   WHERE S THE OTHER LADDER   WHY  I HADN T TO BRING BUT ONE  BILL S GOT THE OTHER  BILL FETCH IT HERE  LAD   HERE  PUT  EM UP AT THIS CORNER  NO  TIE  EM TOGETHER FIRST  THEY DON T REACH HALF HIGH ENOUGH YET  OH  THEY LL DO WELL ENOUGH  DON T BE PARTICULAR  HERE  BILL  CATCH HOLD OF THIS ROPE  WILL THE ROOF BEAR   MIND THAT LOOSE SLATE  OH  IT S COMING DOWN  HEADS BELOW    A LOUD CRASH    NOW  WHO DID THAT   IT WAS BILL  I FANCY  WHO S TO GO DOWN THE CHIMNEY   NAY  I SHAN T  YOU DO IT   THAT I WON T  THEN   BILL S TO GO DOWN  HERE  BILL  THE MASTER SAYS YOU RE TO GO DOWN THE CHIMNEY 
wk,22.7068669991, OH  SO BILL S GOT TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY  HAS HE   SAID ALICE TO HERSELF   SHY  THEY SEEM TO PUT EVERYTHING UPON BILL  I WOULDN T BE IN BILL S PLACE FOR A GOOD DEAL  THIS FIREPLACE IS NARROW  TO BE SURE  BUT I THINK I CAN KICK A LITTLE 
wc,14.1344645576, SHE DREW HER FOOT AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS SHE COULD  AND WAITED TILL SHE HEARD A LITTLE ANIMAL  SHE COULDN T GUESS OF WHAT SORT IT WAS SCRATCHING AND SCRAMBLING ABOUT IN THE CHIMNEY CLOSE ABOVE HER  THEN SAYING TO HERSELF  THIS IS BILL   SHE GAVE ONE SHARP KICK  AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT 
wl,19.5973014981, THE FIRST THING SHE HEARD WAS A GENERAL CHORUS OF  THERE GOES BILL THEN THE RABBIT S VOICE ALONG   CATCH HIM  YOU BY THE HEDGE   THEN SILENCE  AND THEN ANOTHER CONFUSION OF VOICES   HOLD UP HIS HEAD  BRANDY NOW  DON T CHOKE HIM  HOW WAS IT  OLD FELLOW  WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU  TELL US ALL ABOUT IT 
wv,74.7530286898, LAST CAME A LITTLE FEEBLE  SQUEAKING VOICE  [ THAT S BILL   THOUGHT ALICE    WELL  I HARDLY KNOW  NO MORE  THANK YE  I M BETTER NOW  BUT I M A DEAL TOO FLUSTERED TO TELL YOU  ALL I KNOW IS  SOMETHING COMES AT ME LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX  AND UP I GOES LIKE A SKY ROCKET 
ws,20.5424462713, SO YOU DID  OLD FELLOW   SAID THE OTHERS 
wr,31.4581767338, WE MUST BURN THE HOUSE DOWN   SAID THE RABBIT S VOICE  AND ALICE CALLED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD   IF YOU DO  I LL SET DINAH AT YOU 
wc,25.5704505598, THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY  AND ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF   I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT  IF THEY HAD ANY SENSE  THEY D TAKE THE ROOF OFF   AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO  THEY BEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN  AND ALICE HEARD THE RABBIT SAY   A BARROWFUL WILL DO  TO BEGIN WITH 
wg,25.9061329227, A BARROWFUL OF WHAT   THOUGHT ALICE  BUT SHE HAD NOT LONG TO DOUBT FOR THE NEXT MOMENT A SHOWER OF LITTLE PEBBLES CAME RATTLING IN AT THE WINDOW  AND SOME OF THEM HIT HER IN THE FACE   I LL PUT A STOP TO THIS SHE SAID TO HERSELF  AND SHOUTED OUT   YOU D BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN WHICH PRODUCED ANOTHER DEAD SILENCE 
wr,30.031243217, ALICE NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT THE PEBBLES WERE ALL TURNING INTO LITTLE CAKES AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOOR  AND A BRIGHT IDEA CAME INTO HER HEAD   IF I EAT ONE OF THESE CAKES   SHE THOUGHT   IT S SURE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE IN MY SIZE  AND AS IT CAN T POSSIBLY MAKE ME LARGER  IT MUST MAKE ME SMALLER  I SUPPOSE 
ww,29.9605726925, SO SHE SWALLOWED ONE OF THE CAKES  AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT SHE BEGAN SHRINKING DIRECTLY  AS SOON AS SHE WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR  SHE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE  AND FOUND QUITE A CROWD OF LITTLE ANIMALS AND BIRDS WAITING OUTSIDE  THE POOR LITTLE LIZARD  BILL  WAS IN THE MIDDLE  BEING HELD UP BY TWO GUINEA PIGS  WHO WERE GIVING IT SOMETHING OUT OF A BOTTLE  THEY ALL MADE A RUSH AT ALICE THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED  BUT SHE RAN OFF AS HARD AS SHE COULD  AND SOON FOUND HERSELF SAFE IN A THICK WOOD 
wf,26.92734517, THE FIRST THING I VE GOT TO DO   SAID ALICE TO HERSELF  AS SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD   IS TO GROW TO MY RIGHT SIZE AGAIN  AND THE SECOND THING IS TO FIND MY WAY INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN  I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST PLAN 
wg,25.7507530983, IT SOUNDED AN EXCELLENT PLAN  NO DOUBT  AND VERY NEATLY AND SIMPLY ARRANGED  THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS  THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST IDEA HOW TO SET ABOUT IT  AND WHILE SHE WAS PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUSLY AMONG THE TREES  A LITTLE SHARP BARK JUST OVER HER HEAD MADE HER LOOK UP IN A GREAT HURRY 
wi,28.9678636228, AN ENORMOUS PUPPY WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH LARGE ROUND EYES  AND FEEBLY STRETCHING OUT ONE PAW  TRYING TO TOUCH HER   POOR LITTLE THING SAID ALICE  IN A COAXING TONE  AND SHE TRIED HARD TO WHISTLE TO IT  BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED ALL THE TIME AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGRY  IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO EAT HER UP IN SPITE OF ALL HER COAXING 
wo,36.484777306, HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID  SHE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OF STICK  AND HELD IT OUT TO THE PUPPY  WHEREUPON THE PUPPY JUMPED INTO THE AIR OFF ALL ITS FEET AT ONCE  WITH A YELP OF DELIGHT  AND RUSHED AT THE STICK AND MADE BELIEVE TO WORRY IT  THEN ALICE DODGED BEHIND A GREAT THISTLE TO KEEP HERSELF FROM BEING RUN OVER  AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE  THE PUPPY MADE ANOTHER RUSH AT THE STICK  AND TUMBLED HEAD OVER HEELS IN ITS HURRY TO GET HOLD OF IT  THEN ALICE  THINKING IT WAS VERY LIKE HAVING A GAME OF PLAY WITH A CART HORSE  AND EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER ITS FEET  RAN ROUND THE THISTLE AGAIN  THEN THE PUPPY BEGAN A SERIES OF SHORT CHARGES AT THE STICK  RUNNING A VERY LITTLE WAY FORWARDS EACH TIME AND A LONG WAY BACK  AND BARKING HOARSELY ALL THE WHILE  TILL AT LAST IT SAT DOWN A GOOD WAY OFF  PANTING  WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITS MOUTH  AND ITS GREAT EYES HALF SHUT 
wu,36.6019965045, THIS SEEMED TO ALICE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING HER ESCAPE  SO SHE SET OFF AT ONCE  AND RAN TILL SHE WAS QUITE TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH  AND TILL THE PUPPY S BARK SOUNDED QUITE FAINT IN THE DISTANCE 
wq,19.1342020987, AND YET WHAT A DEAR LITTLE PUPPY IT WAS   SAID ALICE  AS SHE LEANT AGAINST A BUTTERCUP TO REST HERSELF  AND FANNED HERSELF WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES   I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TRICKS VERY MUCH  IF  IF I D ONLY BEEN THE RIGHT SIZE TO DO IT  OH DEAR  I D NEARLY FORGOTTEN THAT I VE GOT TO GROW UP AGAIN  LET ME SEE  HOW IS IT TO BE MANAGED  I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO EAT OR DRINK SOMETHING OR OTHER  BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS  WHAT 
wm,29.8249325528, THE GREAT QUESTION CERTAINLY WAS  WHAT  ALICE LOOKED ALL ROUND HER AT THE FLOWERS AND THE BLADES OF GRASS  BUT SHE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO EAT OR DRINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS A LARGE MUSHROOM GROWING NEAR HER  ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS HERSELF  AND WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UNDER IT  AND ON BOTH SIDES OF IT  AND BEHIND IT  IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK AND SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TOP OF IT 
wp,22.0296841075, SHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE  AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MUSHROOM  AND HER EYES IMMEDIATELY MET THOSE OF A LARGE CATERPILLAR THAT WAS SITTING ON THE TOP WITH ITS ARMS FOLDED  QUIETLY SMOKING A LONG HOOKAH  AND TAKING NOT THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF HER OR OF ANYTHING ELSE 
wy,34.1576268076, CHAPTER V  ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR 
wy,20.6981319638, THE CATERPILLAR AND ALICE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR SOME TIME IN SILENCE AT LAST THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH  AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID  SLEEPY VOICE 
wu,9.7914574104, WHO ARE YOU   SAID THE CATERPILLAR 
wy,21.0926561592, THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION  ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY   I  I HARDLY KNOW  SIR  JUST AT PRESENT  AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING  BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN

wc,12.525534149, NOT A BIT   SAID THE CATERPILLAR 
wb,34.7412788411, WELL  PERHAPS YOUR FEELINGS MAY BE DIFFERENT   SAID ALICE   ALL I KNOW IS  IT WOULD FEEL VERY QUEER TO ME 
wb,21.9370820715, YOU   SAID THE CATERPILLAR CONTEMPTUOUSLY   WHO ARE YOU 
wl,18.8122638165, WHICH BROUGHT THEM BACK AGAIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION ALICE FELT A LITTLE IRRITATED AT THE CATERPILLAR S MAKING SUCH VERY SHORT REMARKS  AND SHE DREW HERSELF UP AND SAID  VERY GRAVELY   I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE  FIRST 
ww,12.1067391459, WHY   SAID THE CATERPILLAR 
wd,52.3476280733, HERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION  AND AS ALICE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GOOD REASON  AND AS THE CATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND  SHE TURNED AWAY

wp,9.05598251203, NO   SAID THE CATERPILLAR 
wx,30.5449770025, ALICE THOUGHT SHE MIGHT AS WELL WAIT  AS SHE HAD NOTHING ELSE TO DO  AND PERHAPS AFTER ALL IT MIGHT TELL HER SOMETHING WORTH HEARING  FOR SOME MINUTES IT PUFFED AWAY WITHOUT SPEAKING  BUT AT LAST IT UNFOLDED ITS ARMS  TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AGAIN  AND SAID   SO YOU THINK YOU RE CHANGED  DO YOU 
wl,37.0863534118, I M AFRAID I AM  SIR   SAID ALICE   I CAN T REMEMBER THINGS AS I USED  AND I DON T KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER

wm,21.262963531, OF THE MUSHROOM   SAID THE CATERPILLAR  JUST AS IF SHE HAD ASKED IT ALOUD  AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT 
wm,20.8954799025, ALICE REMAINED LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE MUSHROOM FOR A MINUTE  TRYING TO MAKE OUT WHICH WERE THE TWO SIDES OF IT  AND AS IT WAS PERFECTLY ROUND  SHE FOUND THIS A VERY DIFFICULT QUESTION  HOWEVER  AT LAST SHE STRETCHED HER ARMS ROUND IT AS FAR AS THEY WOULD GO  AND BROKE OFF A BIT OF THE EDGE WITH EACH HAND 
wk,27.4750486466, AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH   SHE SAID TO HERSELF  AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT  THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN  IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT

wz,45.4612203423, AS THERE SEEMED TO BE NO CHANCE OF GETTING HER HANDS UP TO HER HEAD  SHE TRIED TO GET HER HEAD DOWN TO THEM  AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT HER NECK WOULD BEND ABOUT EASILY IN ANY DIRECTION  LIKE A SERPENT  SHE HAD JUST SUCCEEDED IN CURVING IT DOWN INTO A GRACEFUL ZIGZAG  AND WAS GOING TO DIVE IN AMONG THE LEAVES  WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING  WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY  A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE  AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS

wg,61.9415108373, ALICE WAS MORE AND MORE PUZZLED  BUT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS NO USE IN SAYING ANYTHING MORE TILL THE PIGEON HAD FINISHED 
wt,20.2148173282, AS IF IT WASN T TROUBLE ENOUGH HATCHING THE EGGS   SAID THE PIGEON BUT I MUST BE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR SERPENTS NIGHT AND DAY  WHY  I HAVEN T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS 
wk,27.1095794584, I M VERY SORRY YOU VE BEEN ANNOYED   SAID ALICE  WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING

wy,14.1829909299, I DON T BELIEVE IT   SAID THE PIGEON   BUT IF THEY DO  WHY THEN THEY RE A KIND OF SERPENT  THAT S ALL I CAN SAY 
wt,24.2391714009, THIS WAS SUCH A NEW IDEA TO ALICE  THAT SHE WAS QUITE SILENT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO  WHICH GAVE THE PIGEON THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING   YOU RE LOOKING FOR EGGS  I KNOW THAT WELL ENOUGH  AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME WHETHER YOU RE A LITTLE GIRL OR A SERPENT
